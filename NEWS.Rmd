# Superpower 0.0.3

Updates from simple_ANCOVA update `r format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %Y")`

* Added the simple_ANCOVA function
  * Estimates power for simple 2bx2w design (parellel groups; pre-post)
  * Also, allows for precision estimate using Geoff Cummings "margin of error"
  
- Added estimated marginal means comparisons using `emmeans` R package.
  - `emm = TRUE` in the ANOVA_power, ANOVA_exact, and plot_power will result in emmeans being calculated
  - Default is all pairwise comparisons but this can be modified with `contrast_type` and `emm_comp` options
  
- Added global options
  - Options that have crossover between functions can now be set globally for the package
  - Includes: verbose, emm, emm_model, contrast_type, alpha_level, and plot
  - These global options can be seen with Superpower_options()

- Updated Shiny Apps
  - Added numeric input for alpha level (no longer slider)
  - Now includes emmeans options
  - kableExtra, emmeans, magrittr, and dplyr packages now needed to knit markdown file in app.
